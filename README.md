# Wrath of the Lich King Remix Module

The goal of this module is to achieve a Remix-like experience (think [Pandaria](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/wow-remix-mists-of-pandaria-overview) or [Legion Remix](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/wow-remix-legion-overview)) using AzerothCore and the 3.3.5 client.

## Planned Features

- [ ] Retail-like spell learning experience
  - Spells should be automatically learned when they become eligible, no need to talk to a trainer / complete a quest
  - _Note: I realized halfway in that [mod-learnspells](https://github.com/noisiver/mod-learnspells) already does this, however, their implementation differs enough (using existing Trainer data vs custom SQL for spells) that I decided I'll keep mine. Still, it was good inspiration, especially for the Shaman totem stuff. Definitely worth a check out!_
